1. Topic:

I would like to analyse the language of populist rhetoric. In relevant theoretical literature, populist rhetoric is characterized as appealing more to "people" and using simpler languages because of this. Aalberg et al. (2016) describe the populism as a 'thin' ideology that can take many forms depenings on socio-cultural context. They characterize populism as something that appears in "the oral, written, and visual communication of individual politicians, parties, social movements"(Aalberg et al., 2016). I want to investigate this claim further with a textual analysis of speeches by populist politicians.
